    #float and int have different bit values. An int is 2^32 bits, and a float is 2^64 bits. There isn't enough space to represent the number and so the decimal is chopped off.

    #Main Operators: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Modulo(%)
    #Modulo is a division operator that gives the remainder instead of the quotient.
    print(8%5)
    #Modulo and division by 0 is not possible, so it will create errors.
