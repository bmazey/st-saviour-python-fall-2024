    # Recursive functions are functions that call themselves. When using recursive functions you must add a base case and give it a place to stop. In this case, the 0 and 1 in the first two positions are the base.
    # the following code establishes a base case.
    # if n == 0:
    #     return 0
    # if n == 1:
    #     return 1
    # The following lines of code are where the recursion occurs.
    # The number is broken up into the 
    # return fibbonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)
